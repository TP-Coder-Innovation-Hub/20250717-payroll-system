# Initial Payroll System

## Context
Some small companies currently calculate payroll manually, which often leads to human errors and inefficiencies. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to mistakes, impacting payroll accuracy and employee satisfaction. There is a need for a reliable system to automate payroll calculations, reduce errors, and decrease manual workload.

## Decision
Develop a web application with the following characteristics:
- Ability to record employee information and base salary
- Calculate employee payroll based on working days multiplied by base salary
- Frontend developed using React
- Backend developed using Java with Spring Boot framework
- Use PostgreSQL as the database

## Consequences
- Payroll calculation will be more accurate and less error-prone
- The system will be accessible from various devices, including PCs and mobile phones
